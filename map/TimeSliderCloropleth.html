<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I made a mistake and realized that I can't commit the original generated file to Github because it's 190 MB and over the file size limit.</p>

<p>Please unzip TimeSliderCloropleth.zip instead for the correct file.</p>

<p>Or to generate from source, run:</p>
<p>python scuffed_map.py</p>
<p>togenenerate the file again. This may take a couple of minutes. </p>
