# TODO

## RNN

- [ ] Write docstrings for `RNN.py`
- [ ] Move functions out of `RNN_US.ipynb` and into `RNN.py` for modularity
- [ ] Refactor `RNN.py` into a class so that we don't have to constantly pass data back and forth between functions / write larger pipelines for `RNN.py`
- [ ] Merge `RNN.py` data processing functions into main `data_preprocessing` directory for more cohesion
- [ ] Add more data to RNN model, may require further refactoring of `RNN.py`
